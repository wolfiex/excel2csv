11,"For deaths registered from 1 January 2022, cause of death is coded to the ICD-10 classification using MUSE 5.8 software. Deaths registered between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021 were coded to the using MUSE 5.5 and previous years were coded to IRIS 4.2.3. Further information on the software changes are available in Cause of death coding in mortality statistics, software changes publication.","Cause of death coding in mortality statistics, software changes publication."
12,"Deaths ""involving"" a cause include all deaths where the cause was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, as a main cause of death or a contributory cause.

13,"From week ending 26th February 2021 (week 8 2021) new ICD-10 codes for COVID-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) have been implemented for deaths involving COVID-19. The new codes are U09.9 (Post-COVID condition, where the acute COVID had ended before the condition immediately causing death occurred) and U10.9 (Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 (also called Kawasaki-like syndrome), a specific, uncommon effect of COVID-19 in children).

20,"Scotland week allocation differs from other countries. For example, week 1 is week ending 9 January 2022. This has been adjusted for the purpose of aggregating the data.",
21,"UK totals are calculated using the numbers of deaths of usual residents of each of the 4 countries, including any deaths of non-residents that were registered in the UK. Deaths of non-residents are excluded from the separate ""England"" and ""Wales"" breakdowns, so the sum of these 2 countries may differ from ""England and Wales"" totals displayed in this dataset. Deaths of non-residents have been included for the specific Scotland and Northern Ireland country breakdowns to ensure consistency with data published by NRS and NISRA.",
22,"Data for Scotland (and therefore the UK total) are updated every week to ensure consistency with data published by NRS. Data for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are only added for the current week; previous weeks are not updated.",
23,UK data are calculated using England and Wales combined rather than England and Wales country specific data.,
24,Deaths at home are those at the usual residence of the deceased (according to the informant)‚ where this is not a communal establishment.

27,"The 95% confidence interval provides a margin of error within which the true number of death occurrences is likely to lie, subject to the assumptions of the model holding true for the given week.",
28,Estimates for the latest week are based on an incomplete count of registration and are subject to a wider margin of error. They should therefore be treated with caution.,
29,"Does not include deaths of those resident outside England and Wales or those records where the place of residence is either missing or not yet fully coded. For this reason counts for ""Deaths by Region of usual residence"" may not sum to the totals presented in other tables.",
30,The back series has been updated to include refreshed data for the previous 26 weeks by combining the current week’s registration data with past registration data to give the best estimates based on 2015-18 patterns of registration delay.,
